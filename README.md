## 🏆 Achievements

- 🥈 **Silver Medal at Infomatrix Iberoamericana 2025**  
  My undergraduate residency project consisted of developing a basic IoT prototype using a Siemens S7-1200 PLC, FastAPI (Python) backend, and a React web interface.  
  The system collected data from humidity and temperature sensors, displayed the data in real time on a web dashboard, and showed the status (on/off) of fans and a water pump in a greenhouse model.  
  The actuators (fans and water pump) were not controlled from the web interface; their status was only displayed.  
  Although I was not able to present the project at Infomatrix due to finishing my studies, it was successfully presented and awarded a Silver Medal by fellow students who continued the work.
